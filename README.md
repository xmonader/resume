- *0-Disk*: Developed a network block device (NBD) server with multiple backends for storage. The project was later replaced with 0-db (tarantool, fio, lua)
- *AYS*: agentless orchestration infrastructure as code and built on top of Jumpscale framework. Itâ€™s used to provision virtual machines, deploy containers, services and it handles the orchestration and dependencies for the applications.  Developed the Events system, background task, service templates for owncloud, s3, php, nginx
- *OpenVCloud*: cloud platform based on libvirt and Python. Developed new tools for it to improve monitoring and alerting system, and multiple health checks hardware components (e.g IP watcher, dead routeros, fans, power supplies, temperature)
