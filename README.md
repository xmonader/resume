- [*JS-SDK*](https://github.com/threefoldtech/js-sdk): Led the development of threefold grid [software toolkit](https://threefold.io) and the threebot application server. (python, gevent, docker)
- [*VDC*](https://github.com/threefoldtech/vdc): Led the development of Virtual Data Center (kubernetes cluster, S3, monitoring prometheus/grafana, management dashboard) on the Threefold grid, giving customers their own virtual data centers, the stack is (python, gevent, stellar blockchain, kubernetes, ansible, grafana)
- [*VDC Marketplace*](https://github.com/threefoldtech/vdc): Led the development of Virtual Data Center Marketplace (1-click applications deployments on the virtual data center)
- [*Threefold Marketplace*](https://now.threefold.io): Led the development of Threefold marketplace, based on the js-sdk framework, to have 1-click applications running on threefold grid
- [*Terraform/OpenTofu Plugin*](https://github.com/threefoldtech/terraform-provider-grid) Led the development of the terraform plugin for threefold grid (golang)
- [*Golang SDK*](https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfgrid-sdk-go): Led the development of the golang sdk, that was crucial to deliver many projects for threefold grid
- [*TFRobot*](https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfgrid-sdk-go): Led the development of tfrobot, a mass deployer of VM fleets on the threefold grid
- [*Gridify*](https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfgrid-sdk-go): Led the development of gridify, allowing to deploy projects on the threefold grid with minimal effort, similar to heroku based projects.
- [*Farmerbot*](https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfgrid-sdk-go): Led the development of farmerbot allowing the farmers to efficiently power manage their nodes.
- [*Typescript SDK*](https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfgrid-sdk-ts):Led the development of the typescript sdk to enable web developers to integrate with threefold grid, using familiar javascript libraries
- [*Weblets*](https://github.com/threefoldtech/grid_weblets): Svelte based project to create reusable web components to quickly build applications on threefold grid
- [*Go farmer*](https://github.com/xmonader/gofarmer): GUI application to provide farmers with an easy, cross-platform tool to manage their farms (go, fyne)
- [*publishingtools*](https://github.com/crystaluniverse/publishingtools): Led the development of web publishing framework for hosting wikis, blogs and websites mainly for [threefold](https://threefold.io) and its grid services. (crystal, kemal, svelte)

- *0-Disk*: Developed a network block device (NBD) server with multiple backends for storage. The project was later replaced with 0-db (tarantool, fio, lua)
- *AYS*: Agentless orchestration infrastructure as code and built on top of Jumpscale framework. Itâ€™s used to provision virtual machines, deploy containers, services and it handles the orchestration and dependencies for the applications.  Developed the Events system, background task, service templates for owncloud, s3, php, nginx
- *OpenVCloud*: cloud platform based on libvirt and Python. Developed new tools for it to improve monitoring and alerting system, and multiple health checks hardware components (e.g IP watcher, dead routeros, fans, power supplies, temperature)
- More: OAuth provider for *Gogs*, *DMIDecode parser*, *rtinfo* integration, internal development flow automation project (ays_dev_process), github-gogs synchronizer, documentation generators for Jumpscale7 and Jumpscale8
